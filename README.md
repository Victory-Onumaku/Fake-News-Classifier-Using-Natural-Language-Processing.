The overarching objective of this project is to develop an advanced and highly effective fake news classifier utilizing the cutting-edge capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In an era marked by the rampant proliferation of misinformation and fabricated content across digital platforms, the pressing need to distinguish between credible news articles and deceptive or misleading information has never been more crucial. <br>

This project seeks to address this critical societal issue by harnessing the power of NLP, a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Leveraging sophisticated algorithms, linguistic patterns, and semantic analysis, we aim to create a robust and scalable solution capable of automatically discerning genuine news from false or misleading narratives. <br>

In the google colab notebook attached, we will delve into the project’s methodology, data collection and preprocessing, the selection of NLP models, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the classifier’s performance. Our ultimate vision is to equip individuals and communities with a potent weapon against the pernicious influence of fake news, thereby fostering a more discerning, educated, and media-literate society. <br>
